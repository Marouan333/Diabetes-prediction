# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Model using SVM

A machine learning model that predicts whether a person has diabetes based on medical features. Built using Support Vector Machine (SVM), and deployed with **Streamlit** and **Pickle** for interactive use.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to train a classifier that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on input features like glucose level, BMI, age, and more.
